functions have the keyword fn

compile with rustc for small programs

! at the end of a function name is a macro instead of a function

best way to start a new project is with "cargo new 'x'"

build with cargo for bigger projects, sit in top level directory and run "cargo build"

cargo.lock keeps track of the versions of dependancies for the project

can run the program with cargo run, it will also build then run

"cargo check" will check to see if the program would compile but doesn't make an executable

when ready for realease build with "cargo build --realease" to get optimisations
